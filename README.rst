Tree Rings in LSSTCam CCDs
##########################

CTN-010
=======

This paper provides a focal-plane-wide, band-dependent characterization of the LSSTCam tree rings from flat-field observations, derives detector-specific calibration templates suitable for pipeline use, and estimates their impact on photometry, astrometry, shear. 

We provide per-detector, per-band radial profile templates with uncertainties and validation metrics, and describe their integration into the LSST Science Pipelines calibration chain. These results establish the phenomenology of tree rings across the LSSTCam focal plane and deliver practical calibration products for mitigating their impact on LSST science.

Build
=====

This repository includes lsst-texmf_ as a Git submodule.
Clone this repository::

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lsst/ctn-010

    make

Clean built files::

    make clean

Updating acronyms
-----------------

A table of the technote's acronyms and their definitions are maintained in the `acronyms.tex` file, which is committed as part of this repository.
To update the acronyms table in ``acronyms.tex``::

    make acronyms.tex

*Note: this command requires that this repository was cloned as a submodule.*

The acronyms discovery code scans the LaTeX source for probable acronyms.
You can ensure that certain strings aren't treated as acronyms by adding them to the `skipacronyms.txt <./skipacronyms.txt>`_ file.

The lsst-texmf_ repository centrally maintains definitions for LSST acronyms.
You can also add new acronym definitions, or override the definitions of acronyms, by editing the `myacronyms.txt <./myacronyms.txt>`_ file.

Updating lsst-texmf
-------------------

`lsst-texmf`_ includes BibTeX files, the ``lsstdoc`` class file, and acronym definitions, among other essential tooling for LSST's LaTeX documentation projects.
To update to a newer version of `lsst-texmf`_, you can update the submodule in this repository::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

Commit, then push, the updated submodule.
